To do:

Add argparse
	-Number of stacks
	-Number of frames per stack
	-Rotary stage velocity
	-Beginning of file name
	-Location of files
	-Preview
	-Number of cameras
	-Time of test

Find way to stop acquiring

Find a way to check if the required packages are installed

Flesh out functions more

Look into how queue is saving

Add rotary stage
	-Ping for location
	-Spool up
	-Input some velocity

Export fps to file

Improve clock function

Live Preview camera code

Establish some test standard
	-Time everything (relatively)
	-Rotary stage location

Run the test using:
	-Matlab
	-Python code
	-MPM way

Long term goal:
	-Connect to multiple cameras
		-Parallelization?
	-Triggered option
	-Some GUI for python?

Future directions
	-Image analysis

Get powerpoint together
	Line plot: relative time vs number of stacks
